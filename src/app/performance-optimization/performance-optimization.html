        <mat-card-title>Performance Optimization: <code>*ngFor</code> and <code>trackBy</code></mat-card-title>
    </mat-card-header>
    <mat-card-content>
        <p>
            This example demonstrates how <code>trackBy</code> can improve performance when rendering lists with
            <code>*ngFor</code>.
            When a list is updated, Angular re-renders the DOM elements. Without <code>trackBy</code>, Angular might
            destroy and
            recreate DOM elements even if the underlying data for an item hasn't changed, especially if the array
            reference changes or items are reordered.
            With <code>trackBy</code>, you provide a function that returns a unique identifier for each item. Angular
            uses this to
            track items, reordering or updating existing DOM elements instead of recreating them if the item (identified
            by <code>trackBy</code>)
            is still present.

            <strong>Instructions:</strong> Open your browser's developer console. Click the buttons below and observe
            the console logs.
            The logs simulate (in a very basic way) how many times an item "re-renders".
            Pay attention to the difference in log counts between the "Without TrackBy" and "With TrackBy" lists,
            especially after "Refresh Data" or "Modify First Item".
            In a real application, you would use browser profiling tools to see the actual DOM manipulations and
            performance gains.

        <h4>Problem Statement / Interview Scenario:</h4>
        <p>
            An application displays a frequently updated list of complex items. Users report sluggishness when the list
            refreshes.
            Upon inspection (e.g., using browser dev tools, element inspection, or profiler), it's observed that many
            DOM elements
            are being destroyed and recreated even for items whose data hasn't fundamentally changed but might have been
            reordered or
            the list was replaced with a new array instance containing mostly the same items.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Describe the default DOM manipulation behavior of <code>*ngFor</code> when the list data changes. Why
                can this lead to performance issues, especially with lists of complex components or frequent updates?
            </li>
            <li>How can <code>trackBy</code> help in this scenario? Explain its mechanism.</li>
            <li>Implement a <code>trackBy</code> function for an item structure like:
                <code>{ id: number; name: string; data: any; }</code>. What makes a good <code>trackBy</code> function?
            </li>
            <li>What are the potential downsides or considerations when implementing <code>trackBy</code>? (e.g., cost
                of the tracking function itself, ensuring unique and stable IDs). When might using <code>trackBy</code>
                <em>not</em> provide a significant performance benefit, or even be slightly detrimental?</li>
            <li>Apart from observing console logs as in this demo, what specific browser developer tools or
                Angular-specific tools would you use to precisely measure and confirm the performance impact of
                implementing <code>trackBy</code>?</li>
            <li>Beyond <code>trackBy</code>, what are two other common Angular performance optimization techniques you
                would consider for a component that renders a large amount of data or updates frequently? (e.g.,
                ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush, virtual scrolling)</li>
        </ol>
